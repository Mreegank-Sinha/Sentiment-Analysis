# Sentiment-Analysis
Introduction
This project applies BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews collected via web scraping. By leveraging deep learning and NLP techniques, the model classifies customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights for restaurant businesses.

ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights

âœ… Web scraping to collect real-world restaurant reviews
âœ… Data preprocessing, including text cleaning and tokenization
âœ… Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification
âœ… Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
âœ… Scalable and customizable for different industries

ðŸ“Œ Dataset
The dataset consists of customer reviews scraped from a restaurant review website. The scraped data includes:

Review text: The actual customer feedback
Rating (optional): Star-based ratings (if available)
Date of review: Helps analyze sentiment trends over time
The data is preprocessed to remove special characters, stopwords, and redundant text, followed by tokenization using BERTâ€™s tokenizer.
